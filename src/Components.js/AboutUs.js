        <p><b>As we know in this advance world things are much easier and convenient for us with the help of technologies and latest developments in software world. We can do anything from home for example online shopping, online transactions, online bookings etc  If we talk about the clothingâ€™s and fashion industries in Pakistan it is a highly competitive multi-billion dollar industry, starting a clothing line or an online clothing business is more accessible than ever before. I want to make a website where we can design our own cloths in that website the user will give information about what kind of dress they want the user will select the fabric of their own choice, we will provide them the list of latest and trending designs and they can either choose one from them or design their own. There will be a section after designing the dress the user will give all the necessary information like the measurements ,size etc in the measurements section. At the end the user will have to fill a form in which they will provide us their name contact, address etc and place the order the details for payment method will also be mentioned .</b></p>
